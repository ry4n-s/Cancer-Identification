# Cancer Identification 🧬🔍

## 🌟 Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive Python project for analyzing and classifying human cell samples based on cancer presence. Utilizing a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the project showcases data pre-processing, visualization, and machine learning using various Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.

## 📈 Features
- **Data Acquisition and Processing**: Scripts for downloading and preprocessing cancer cell data, including handling non-numerical values.
- **Visualization**: Code for plotting data points, highlighting the differences between benign and malignant samples.
- **Machine Learning Modeling**: Implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) models using different kernel functions (RBF and Linear) to classify cells.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Scripts for computing confusion matrices, F1 scores, and Jaccard indices to evaluate model performance.

## 📚 Libraries Used
- `Pandas` for data manipulation.
- `Matplotlib` & `Pylab` for data visualization.
- `NumPy` & `Scipy` for numerical operations.
- `Scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.

## 📉 Dataset
- The project uses the publicly available cancer cell dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing several features related to cell characteristics.
- The dataset includes various fields from Clump Thickness to Mitosis, along with a class label indicating benign or malignant samples.

## 🧪 Model Training and Testing
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training SVM models with different kernels.
- Evaluating model performance using various metrics.
